# Build a RESTful CRUD API with Golang Gin and Gorm

Building a RESTful CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API with Golang, Gin, and Gorm is a straightforward process. Gin is a popular web framework for building APIs in Golang, and Gorm is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for working with databases in Golang. Together, these two libraries make it easy to build a robust and efficient CRUD API.
